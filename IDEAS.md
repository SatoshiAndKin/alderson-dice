allowances?

permit?

a game accepts dice from many NFT contracts? that way we can have dice from one yearn vault

you submit a dice bag. we do offchain computations to calculate the winners?

The "balance" is used in the game like a level for the NFT.

if someone puts in $20, ERC721 works okay. burning is burning 10 tokens. but if someone puts in $100,000 what happens? burning takes 100,000 actions? thats not going to work. so lets do 5 levels of tokens. then collecting them all is 25 dice? Or maybe it should be 150 like the original pokemon. 150
