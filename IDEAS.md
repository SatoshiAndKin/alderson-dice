allowances?

permit?

a game accepts dice from many NFT contracts? that way we can have dice from one yearn vault

you submit a dice bag. we do offchain computations to calculate the winners?

The "balance" is used in the game like a level for the NFT.

if someone puts in $20, ERC721 works okay. burning is burning 10 tokens. but if someone puts in $100,000 what happens? burning takes 100,000 actions? thats not going to work. so lets do 5 levels of tokens. then collecting them all is 25 dice? Or maybe it should be 150 like the original pokemon. 150

dice can be staked in a gauge to earn points. points can be spent to upgrade a dice or even change its color. points CANNOT buy dice because all dice must have backing.

contract that wraps the 6909 into an ERC721. this will allow trading. maybe the "favorites" system should use this? have a 721 "diceBag"
